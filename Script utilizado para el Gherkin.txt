  Background:
    Given the PetStore API is available
 
  Scenario: Create an order
    When I send a POST request to "/store/order" with the following order details
      | id   | petId | quantity | shipDate            | status | complete |
      | 1    | 101   | 2        | 2024-08-08T14:30:00 | placed | true     |
    Then the response code should be 200
    And the response body should contain the order details
      | id   | petId | quantity | shipDate            | status | complete |
      | 1    | 101   | 2        | 2024-08-08T14:30:00 | placed | true     |

    Given an order with ID "1" exists
    When I send a GET request to "/store/order/1"
